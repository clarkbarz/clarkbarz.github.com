title: What's Your Favorite Color?
---

	According to [Monty Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWS8Mg-JWSg) and the rest of society, 'What's your favorite color?' has been one of those questions that's important, yet relatively harmless in the grand scheme of things (unless you're hunting for the Holy Grail). Personally, I don't think I've ever been able to give what I felt was an honest answer for to the question.

	What's the merit of an individual color? They are all so similar in essence that their differences of sole wavelength seems trivial and almost negligable when considering and contrasting different colors against each other, and I've honestly never been able to give a straight answer to question that I feel like I've been asked again and again.

	Thinking about it, I feel as though a better question would pursue an individual's favorite color scheme, or colors that he or she would perceive to go well together in accordance with his or her own preferences as well as the less important public standard for which colors go well together. Personally, while I've never been able to give an honest answer of what my favorite color is, I've always been drawn towards the color scheme of grey and navy blue with an optional/occasional red trim.
